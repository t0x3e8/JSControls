JS Controls is a tiny project which consists of 2 controls to represent numeric value as a circle chart or a bar chart.
This project is create for educational purposes, to study JavaScript and development of SPA. The solution is based on the "Single Page Application‚Äù book.

You can copy, modify and even make fortune on this project. I am fine with this ;) Enjoy!
